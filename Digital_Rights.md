Intro
Everybody should benefit from the digital revolution. At the moment the UK is behind the curve.  We need to invest in truly world class infrastructure and upskilling citizens to effectively utilise this.. To help facilitate an online world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We must recognise that anyone from any location can and should be able express their beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity online.

No bundling of services
The bundling of services with hardware has created artificial barriers to entry in a number of markets in the last decade. To ensure that innovation is possible and to improve competition we would aim to introduce a requirement that the providers of bundled services, software and hardware products price and offer each component individually as well as in a bundle. We will prevent through legislation locking of newly manufactured or resold electronic devices, whether the locking of software to hardware or hardware to a service.We should also add something here about publicly funded schemes - if there are publically funded schemes to take laptops out, provide WiFi etc, they should use unbundled services where possible. I would think this needs to be fleshed out a bit, are you saying all mobile phones should be sold unlocked for example? also it is sometimes a question of hardware/software compatibility which prevents these services being bundled together.

Re-imagine the Open Source Action Plan
The government's existing but widely ignored Open Source Action Plan should be re-imagined and properly implemented across government, and will be promoted to the public and private sectors. The Action Plan encourages the use of free and open source software, saving money where practical and economically viable. Agree!  Agree.  Could we add that, where possible, dovernment should look at CC or open source licensing on all materials too, or is that outside the scope of this poilcy?
How about encouraging Government IT to also contribute back to any open source project they use?

National Events should be accessible online
The current list of important national events that cannot be exclusively broadcast by pay TV services must be maintained and expanded. We will introduce a mandate that such events be available via both broadcast and online distribution.Agree! Agree, Some examples of such events would be good here. Is there an existing list of such important event? Here’s ofcoms list of sport & other designated events. http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/other-codes/ofcom_code_on_sport.pdf
What would count as a national event that would mean it should be included on the list?

Open Government Licence
The Open Government Licence will be expanded to all government funded data and material. All maps, statistics and other data that have been created or collated by the government will be released in open formats, giving the public access to research for which they have already paid. An exception will be made for cases that have national security or privacy concerns. Agree! Agree. Possible stipulation that anything that isn’t realise needs a detail reason why not, rather than just a blanket national security get out?

Repeal Copyright infringement section of Digital Economy Act
We will repeal sections 3 to 18 of the Digital Economy Act 2010 and strengthen the current protections against excessive or frivolous lawsuits for copyright infringement.

Limit Digital Rights Management
There is an urgent need to raise public awareness about Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology. We believe the public needs to be protected from products that can be remotely turned off by the manufacturer, products that 'phone home' and would therefore stop working if the manufacturer went bankrupt, or products that are 'region coded'. We will require that any product sold in the UK that includes a DRM mechanism is stored in without DRM in escrow against a time where access to DRM versions is no longer possible.Agree!

Reform Copyright laws
A fair and balanced copyright regime that is suitable for the 21st century is an absolute necessity for the UK to remain competitive in a global economy that is built upon ideas and innovation. Copyright should give artists and innovators the chance to make money from their work; however, that needs to be balanced with the rights of society as a whole.

We will ensuring that new copyrights are not created unless the new work represents a substantial change, we will remove the loophole in current copyright law that allows 'restarting the clock' by simply moving content to a new format or making an incremental change to it.
We will legalise the use of copyright works where no money changes hands, which will return to the people various rights including:
A right to “format shift” (for example, buying a CD then copying it to a portable media player such as an MP3 player or phone); I think generally people will buy less CDs but we are generally in a situation where anything we listen to on spotify for example is not ours, we are renting it nowadays.
A right to share files between friends and peers (which provides free advertising that is essential for less well-known artists); This is a complex situation and a case could be also made for less well-known artists not making any money at all through file sharing. what we need is a legal files sharing site like Piratebay which allows users the facility to make micro payments if they choose towards any content they download. And micro payment functionality which doesn’t incur a government tax as well probably.

We will reduce the duration of copyright to 10 years, closer to the original duration of 14 years, reflecting the much greater ease with which works can now be made and distributed. Shorter copyright will encourage artists to keep on creating new work; will allow new art forms, such as mashupsmash-ups; and will stop big businesses from relying on large back-catalogues rather than investing in new content. Agree! Agree that copyright duration should be shorten. Surely we could mention explicit exceptions for mashups / satire / fair use in repurposing existing media into a new piece of art or social commentary?

Provide Public Wifi
We will promote the provision of free public WiFi as well as the provision of Internet access in community centres and libraries by local authorities. Also hospitals, as this also breaks up the monopoly of hospital comms suppliers chanrging patients for television At present a significant portion of us have limited access to the Internet and the benefits that access provides. Providing access where it is otherwise limited is a good initial step to reducing and eventually ending the digital divide.4g+/LTE should also be made available in all rural areas, this negates the need to dig up ground and lay cable/fiber optic.  - Currently, one of the major issues is that BT control a monopoly on wires where Virgin don’t exist.  As a result, many communities are simply told “No” even if they can raise the cash - we need to cover this.  I’m going to run this issue past a couple of experts I know in the subject...Planning ahead, fibre/cable will be much less of an issue, in just a few years we will be able to have over the air networks which will rival current cable speeds (around 152mb).   Not in rural areas.  I don’t even have a DAB signal where I live….though I agree will be less of an issue I think it needs to be a policy that the large network providers have to be mandated to provide coverage as part of any overall package they are given by a government. What are people’s thoughts on the current scheme to promote rural broadband? I lean towards a nationalisation of the copper / fibre and some sort of guaranteed level of service/speed rather than have BT Openreach in charge

All UK routers must ship with guest mode enabled with SSID as openwireless.org so WiFi is practically available everywhere for zero cost when you need it (yes it's piggy backing on people's WiFi but they can turn it off if they're bothered). Will this create issues with people using open wifi to access illegal porn sites etc? It also runs the risk of a user's home network being compromised .  I’m unsure on the wisdom of this - would it be better to provide incentives for people to open this rather than mandating it?

Can we add a section about the digital skills needed to use broadband (declaration of interest, this is my area of work)?  I think without the skills to understand the importance, dangers, implications of online engagement, let alone the skills to utilise it much of this is for nothing.

Digitial Privacy - GCHQ, Surveillence and “anonymised” data.

We will promote the extension of the privacy you would expect in the real world into the digital.
Most of GCHQ’s operations would be fine if they where not super charged by paranoid anti-terror legislation
